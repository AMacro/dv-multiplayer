# Important!
At present, assume all other mods are incompatible!
Some mods may work, but many do cause issues and break multiplayer capabilities.

Our primary focus is to have the vanilla game working in multiplayer; once this is achieved we will then work on compatibility with other mods.


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Multiplayer is a Derail Valley mod that adds multiplayer to the game, allowing you to play with your friends.

It works by having one player host a game, and then other players can join that game.

This fork is a continuation of [Insprill's](https://github.com/Insprill/dv-multiplayer) amazing efforts.



<!-- Roadmap -->

## Roadmap

For a list of planned features, see the [project board][project-board-url].  
The mod will be released on Nexus once it's ready.




<!-- BUILDING -->

## Building

Before you can build Multiplayer, you'll need to build the Unity project.  
To do this, open the `MultiplayerAssets` folder in Unity **2019.4.40f1**, then click on the `Multiplayer` > `Build Asset Bundle and Scripts ` menu item.

Once the Unity project is compiled, the rest of the mod uses the same build system as Mapify which you can read about in the [Mapify building documentation][mapify-building-docs].
